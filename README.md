# TaiPower

Tai Power is a small app that simulates user mouse input. 

Background
As a joke I wrote a program that jumps one pixel every two minutes, 
as if it is user input. This was to fool the then unsophisticated, and somewhat stalker-is, 
'productivity' trackers on my friends's back, or at the very least, to never show away when 
you really needed to visit the bathroom just one second too long. 

Technicals
Tracks last user input, test the delta time against a predefined threshold, then execute the pixel jump. 
In depth:
Uses GetLastUserInput, and employs User32.dll to pixel jump

Development of the next step. 
When the basic functionality was done, the project felt a little bland and it then enjoyed some 
custom Tai emoji graphics (Courtesy of SnapChat, well maybe not courteously given ..). and the 
path was modified to follow the like of the DVD icon, and the DVD icon was added. 

Feel free to ask any questions or make suggestions. Market research indicate that network pong 
will go down terribly as there is no active interest or user present when the game starts.
